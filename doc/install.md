# Manual Installation

__Notes:__
- Hyphe is intended to be installed using Docker on most OS (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux). Building manually is only possible under Linux distributions. It can be complex due to a variety of issues and is therefore not guaranteed. Please rather use the regular Docker install if you have little experience with command line and Linux administration.
- MongoDB is limited to 2GB databases on 32bit systems, so we recommend to always install Hyphe on a 64bit machine.
- Do __not__ add `sudo` to any of the following example commands. Every piece of shell written here should be ran from Hyphe's root directory and `sudo` should only be used when explicitly listed.

The following installation instructions have been tested under Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS. It should be possible to adapt these commands to older or more recent Ubuntu versions and diverse Debian and CentOS distributions (using `yum` instead of `apt` where necessary and so on).

[MongoDB Community Edition (v3.6, the last free software version)](http://www.mongodb.org/) (a NoSQL database server), [ScrapyD](http://scrapyd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) (a crawler framework server) and Python 2.7 are required for the backend to work.


## 0) Get global requirements

First, install possible missing required basics using apt/aptitude:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git curl apache2 build-essential gcc musl-dev python2.7-dev python-pip libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev openssl libssl-dev libffi-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxmlsec1-dev liblzma-dev
```

Or, with yum under CentOS/RedHat like distributions, the packages names can be slightly different and some extra commands might be required:
```bash
sudo yum check-update
sudo yum install git patch curl httpd gcc python-devel python-setuptools python2-pip libxml2-devel libxslt-devel openssl openssl-devel libffi-devel zlib-devel bzip2-devel readline-devel sqlite-devel`
# Fix possibly misnamed pip
pip > /dev/null || alias pip="python-pip"
# Activate Apache's autorestart on reboot
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd
```

Then prepare to use multiple python environments with the help of [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) which can be easily installed using [`pyenv-installer`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer):

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/raw/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash
```

And set it up by adding the proper environment variables within your `.bashrc` and/or `.bash_profile` or equivalent as the installer should tell you to do, or by following [these instructions](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#b-set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv), then close and reopen your terminal.

pyenv is a convenient tool to handle multiple python versions and environments for a single user on a machine without requiring any system install with root rights.

So let's first prepare it by installing a recent python 3.12 version for our user:

```bash
pyenv install 3.12.4
```


## 1) Clone the source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medialab/hyphe hyphe
cd hyphe
```


## 2) Install [MongoDB v3.6](http://www.mongodb.org/)

Hyphe relies on the latest open source version of MongoDB community edition, which is now easiest to install using Docker:

```bash
docker pull mongo:3.6
```

Then when developing, you'll need to run your MongoDB Docker image in a dedicated terminal with the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 27017:27017 -v mongo-data:/data/db --name mongo-hyphe mongo:3.6 mongod --smallfiles --bind_ip 0.0.0.0 --setParameter failIndexKeyTooLong=false
```

You can also try to find old packages for your distribution.

For instance for Ubuntu:

```bash
wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-3.6.asc | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu/dists/bionic/mongodb-org/3.6 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.6.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
sudo service mongod restart
```

Or for CentOS 7.9:

```bash
echo """[mongodb-org-3.6]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/7/mongodb-org/3.6/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-3.6.asc""" | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-3.6.repo
sudo yum update
sudo yum install -y mongodb-org
sudo systemctl enable mongod
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

In order to avoid very rare issues with crazy long urls found by the crawler on the web, the following setting should be set onto mongo globally:

```bash
mongo --eval "db.getSiblingDB('admin').runCommand( { setParameter: 1, failIndexKeyTooLong: false } )"
```

For development and administrative use, you can also optionally install the following project to easily access and manage MongoDB's databases:
- [RoboMongo](http://robomongo.org/): a shell-centric GUI


## 3) Install [ScrapyD](http://scrapyd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

Hyphe uses an old version of ScrapyD which is not packaged so we will install it locally in a dedicated pyenv environment and dedicated directory.

```bash
mkdir -p scrapyd
cd scrapyd
mkdir -p eggs dbs log
pyenv virtualenv 3.12.4 scrapyd
pyenv local scrapyd
pyenv activate scrapyd
```

Thanks to the `pyenv local` command, there should now reside in the scrapyd directory a `.python-version` file which will let pyenv know whenever you enter this directory within a terminal to use the dedicated python environment.

Let's then install ScrapyD's dependencies and configuration for Hyphe's crawler within the environment:

```bash
cat ../hyphe_backend/crawler/requirements-scrapyd.txt | sudo xargs -n 1 -L 1 pip install
ln -s `pwd`/hyphe_backend/crawler/scrapyd.config scrapyd.conf
```

ScrapyD will store logs and useful files within the `eggs`, `dbs` and `log` directories we created here, but you can adjust the paths of these if required within the `scrapyd.conf` file.

And finally run ScrapyD manually, using for instance nohup for persistance:

```bash
nohup scrapyd > scrapyd.out 2> scrapyd.err &
```

Or for development by just running the `scrapyd` command within a dedicated terminal in this directory.

You can test whether ScrapyD is properly installed and running by querying [http://localhost:6800/listprojects.json](http://localhost:6800/listprojects.json). If everything is normal, you should see something like this:

```json
{"status": "ok", "projects": []}
```


## 4) Setup Hyphe's backend Python virtual environment

Let's first go back to the root directory of Hyphe where it was cloned and use pyenv again to create Hyphe's dedicated python environment:

```bash
# Prepare VirtualEnv
pyenv virtualenv 2.7.18 hyphe
pyenv local hyphe
pyenv activate hyphe

# Install Hyphe's dependencies
cat requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 -L 1 pip install
pwd > ~/.pyenv/versions/hyphe/lib/python3.11/site-packages/hyphe.pth
```


## 5) Build Hyphe's frontend

First install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), either from your system's packages `nodejs` and `npm` or a more [recent version from official sources]https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

Then in Hyphe's frontend directory, install dependencies and build the bundle:

```bash
cd hyphe_frontend
npm install
cd ..
```


## 6) Configure Hyphe

### 6.1) Setup the backend

- Copy and adapt the sample from the `config` directory `config.json.example` to `config.json`:

```bash
sed "s|##HYPHEPATH##|"`pwd`"|" config/config.json.example > config/config.json
```

- Edit the `config.json` file and adjust the settings as explained in the [configuration documentation](config.md)


### 6.2) Setup the frontend

Copy and adapt the sample `conf_default.js` to `conf.js` in the `hyphe_frontend/app/conf` directory:

```bash
sed "s|##WEBPATH##|hyphe|" hyphe_frontend/app/conf/conf_default.js > hyphe_frontend/app/conf/conf.js
```


### 6.3) Serve everything with Apache

Or with anything else, just serve statically the `hyphe_frontend/app` directory with any web server, for instance with

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

The backend core API relies on a Twisted web server serving on a dedicated port (defined as `core_api_port` in `config.json` just before). For external access, proxy redirection is handled by Apache.

- Copy and adapt the sample `apache2_example.conf` from the `config` directory:

```bash
twport=$(grep '"core_api_port"' config/config.json | sed 's/[^0-9]//g')
sed "s|##HYPHEPATH##|"`pwd`"|" config/apache2_example.conf |
sed "s|##TWISTEDPORT##|$twport|" |
sed "s|##WEBPATH##|hyphe|" > config/apache2.conf
```

- Install it as an Apache website:

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
# Enable use of mod_proxy & mod_proxy_http
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http

# Install & enable site
sudo ln -s `pwd`/config/apache2.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/hyphe.conf
sudo a2ensite hyphe

# Reload Apache
sudo service apache2 reload
```

On CentOS/RedHat:

```bash
# Apache's mod_proxy & mod_proxy_http usually ship with Httpd on CentOS machines but it might be missing.
# Ensure it is indeed present running the following command and google how to install it otherwise
grep -r "^\s*LoadModule.*mod_proxy_http" /etc/httpd/

# Install site
sudo ln -s `pwd`/config/apache2.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/hyphe.conf

# Reload Apache
sudo service httpd reload
```

This will install Hyphe locally only first: [http://localhost/hyphe](http://localhost/hyphe). The page should be accessible even though the website should not work yet since we have not started the server, see next section.

If you encounter issues here or would like to serve Hyphe on the web, please [see the related documentation](serve.md#if-you-installed-manually).


## 7) Run Hyphe!

To start the server's daemon, run the following:

```bash
python hyphe_backend/core.tac
```

Here again, for production uses, you can let it run using for instance nohup:

```bash
nohup python hyphe_backend/core.tac > log/hyphe.out 2>&1 &
```

You should now be able to enjoy Hyphe at [http://localhost/hyphe](http://localhost/hyphe)!
